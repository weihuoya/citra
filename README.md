## What is the most important?
Something that was the most important to the whole project was to make sure that we could be fine with most game engines ( even though some of them are not official or supported yet by some companies. They have seen traditional programming myself ) and without the nasty Truectrl interface.

The usual way to make sure is simple, don't make it unique for yours.
It was my decision that Kotlin is to be the language for the cross-platform, Real-time add-ons. Why Kotlin? It's easy. It's a nicer and prettier language and is less buggy. You'll be fine programming all of these in Kotlin.

Each code base is compiled ( auto-loading ) and included in the SmartX-Compiler and SmartPlay for iOS

To run the project on iPhone, we have gone for the more modern SmartPlay project. It runs under Android, Constant iOS version.

[NVIDIA CUDA is also included for 3d render and post processing].
